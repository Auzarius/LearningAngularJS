This is a fork of [PWillaims](https://github.com/PWilliams0530) [LearningAngularJS](https://github.com/PWilliams0530/LearningAngularJS) project.  Aside from adding one function to app.js for testing this is mostly just a reskin by throwing out the old CSS file and starting from scratch.  The index.html file was also restructured a bit to accomodate the new design.  The javascript and libraries should be up to date with the original project.

- [X] Created a new CSS (SASS) file to replace the old one.
- [X] Added the getRandomWeight() function to app.js as requested.
- [X] Improved index.html layout and presentation to better accomodate users.
